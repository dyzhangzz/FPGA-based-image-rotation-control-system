# FPGA-based-image-rotation-control-system
In this design, the image rotation control system first studied the algorithm of image rotation, compared various mappings and interpolation algorithms, and adopted a real-time based on image rotation processing and a bilinear interpolation-based inverse mapping that facilitates hardware implementation. The algorithm can minimize the computational complexity of the system while ensuring the image quality.
